"Why are you here?"
Rick Falkvinge

Oslo, 2013-03-16


The first question is...

I worked in Oslo when I was young, so my Swedish 
and Norwegian is completely mixed up when I've 
arrived in Oslo now.

So the question is, do you want me to speak in 
English or my mix that's not neither Swedish or 
Norwegian?

[Svorsk! Svorsk! Svorsk!]

All right.

Everywhere I go these days, I always start my 
presentations by standing here acting a little 
ashamed for a while just to make the organizers 
nervous. And then I'll say I have a confession. 
I know that I shouldn't start the speech in a 
negative way, but I need to say this:

I'm a politician.

I never meant my life to turn out this way, I 
started to talk about what was wrong in the 
world together with my friends on Friday and 
Saturday evenings over a beer. Then I started to 
talk politics several days during the week, over 
a cup of coffee, and it gradually took over my 
life. And before I knew it, I'd put up a website 
that started a movement that spread to more than 
60 countries.

And that could happen to anyone, I'd say. I will 
come back to that later.

Because my question is: "Why are you here?"
It's a completely serious question.

Why do you sit here today?
Are you out of your mind?

Do you really think you can change the world
by starting a new political party?

We've all been told how it should be done when 
we want to change something in the society:

We send a letter to the local newspaper, then 
they might put it into their reader column, and 
we've done our duty as a good citizen. And then 
we change the world.

What are you doing here?

I'm going to tell why I'm here
and why I'm doing this.

Around 120 years ago, a couple of young 
activists noticed an injustice in the world.

They noted that the king and the church could 
largely say whatever they wanted and have their 
way. Â¤

They got an idea from earlier philosophers, 
early ideas about the rights of the individual.

So they began to argue that people had certain 
inherent rights and should say no to both king 
and church and the establishment.
